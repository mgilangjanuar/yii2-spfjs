# Contributing

SPF is an open source project. It is licensed using the
[MIT License][]. We appreciate pull requests; here are our
guidelines:

1.  [File a bug][] (if there isn't one already).  If your patch
    is going to be large it might be a good idea to get the
    discussion started early.  We are happy to discuss it in a
    new issue beforehand, and you can always email
    <spfjs@googlegroups.com> about future work.

2.  Due to legal reasons, all contributors must sign a
    contributor license agreement, either for an [individual][]
    or [corporation][], before a patch can be accepted.

3.  Please use [Google JavaScript Style][].

4.  We ask that you squash all the commits together before
    pushing and that your commit message references the bug.
